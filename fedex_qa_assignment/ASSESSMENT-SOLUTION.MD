## Installation

For project setup and running e2e tests please refer to README.md file.

The testing of this project is based on Cucumber and cypress (BDD approach). 
Since cypress is already installed during the steps in the README, you can now install the cypress-cucumber-preprocessor using the following URL:
```bash
  https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md
```
For reporting we use Mochawesome
```bash
  npm i --D mocha mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator
```  
## Optimizations
